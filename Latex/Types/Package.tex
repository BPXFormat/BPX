\section{BPX Type: Package ('P')}

\subsection{Overview}
The Package BPX is using 'P' as the type byte of BPX Main Header. This type provides asset packages using the BPX format.
\newline
Below is a table describing the different sections to be expected in a BPXP:
\bpxsectiontable
{
    Data & 1 & Yes & No \\
    Strings & 255 & Yes & Yes \\
}
NOTE: The order of Data sections MUST be contiguous. A file is allowed to be divided in multiple sections, however a file header MUST NOT be divided. The Strings section can be either first or last in the file.

\subsection{Data}
The Data section is used to store one or more files. Each file begins by a file header which is defined as:

\bpxfieldtable
{
    Size & Unsigned & 64 & File size \\
    Path & Unsigned & 32 & Pointer in the Strings section \\
}

\subsubsection{Size}
The total size of the file to read. When extracting a file which size is greater than the remaining bytes in the section just continue reading from next section as if the next section was simply a continuation of the current one.

\subsubsection{Path}
The path as a pointer to a null terminated string in the strings section. Used to identify relative extraction location or the virtual path of the asset in a rendering application.

\subsection{Strings}
The strings section contains a list of null-terminated strings to be referenced by start offset from other sections.
