\section{History}
The BPX format, also refered to as BlockProject Extended, is a remake of an old format designed for the first version of the BlockProject 3D engine as an attempt to allow moddability, that means changing the behaviour of a game while it's running and in this case also changing any multimedia assets including scenes, shaders, models and even textures...\newline
This has proved to be a difficult task due to licensing issues, restrictions imposed by existing frameworks and restrictions imposed by certain formats.\newline
As a result, a custom asset format was initially developed for a very limited set of asset types in order to solve the issue.\newline
This format is an evolution geared towards re-usability and performance.
