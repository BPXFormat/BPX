\section{General}
The format is based on the idea of a container with a reusable main header that can be extended for the different applications.\newline
The following assumptions are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A byte is assumed to be 8 bits.
    \item The sizes are expressed in bits in the entire document.
    \item The byte order in a BPX file should be \textbf{little endian} to match most of current hardware/software architectures, and then avoid a pre-processing step when loading the file.
    \item A transformation is stored in terms of float to match most current rendering APIs.
    \item The coordinate system used for this format is assumed to be left handed with the Z axis to be pointing upward.
\end{itemize}
Description of the coordinate system:
\begin{equation}
    Left =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\
        0 \\
        0
    \end{pmatrix}
    Forward =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1 \\
        0
    \end{pmatrix}
    Up =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The TypeExt section available in certain BPX types describes what fields to expect in the 40 bits of extension located in the BPX Main Header.

\section{Padding rules}
All data structures exposed in this format specification are padded to comply with major C/C++ compilers: Visual C++, GCC and Clang.
